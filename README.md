This repository contains all the data and code necessary to replicate the analysis described in Lang et al. (2022): 
https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.07.20.500889.
</br>
A logical order for running the scripts is indicated by the alphabetical prefix (in theory, if you were to run everything step by step, it might make sense to do it in the order indicated). However, all of the scripts can be run independently by accessing the intermediate data structures in this repository (not yet added as of 8/16/22).

Much more detail can be found within each script.
